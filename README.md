# Simple Neural Network on Semeion handwritten digits dataset using both TensorFlow and scikit-learn

Neural Network structure: one hidden layer with n hidden units (n should be a parameter of your program function) and 10 output units. The network should be fully connected. <br>
Activation function: Hidden and output units should use the sigmoid activation function. <br>
Bias unit: Every hidden and output unit should have a weighted connection from bias unit, whose value should be set to 1. <br>
Output: The output units should correspond to one of 10 classes (1 to 9). Set the target value tk for output unit k to 0.9 if input class is the kth class, 0.1 otherwise. <br>
Training: Use backpropagation with SGD to train the network. Set the learning rate to 0.1.
